# Swim Land Training

A super simple mobile-first land training tracker for gym, mobility, and flexibility work. It is a static React + Vite + TypeScript app designed to run for free on GitHub Pages with all version 1 data stored in browser `localStorage`.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Plain CSS
- Browser `localStorage`
- GitHub repository JSON sync
- GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions

No backend API, database, server-side hosting, or paid service is required. GitHub sync uses the GitHub Contents API from the browser when you enter a fine-grained token.

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite will print the local URL, usually `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The static site is generated in `dist/`.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This repository includes `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.

1. Push the app to the `main` branch.
2. In GitHub, open the repository settings.
3. Go to **Pages**.
4. Set **Build and deployment** to **GitHub Actions**.
5. Push to `main` or run the workflow manually.

The workflow installs dependencies, runs `npm run build`, uploads `dist`, and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

## Vite Base Path

The current repository is `GymApp`, so `vite.config.ts` uses:

```ts
base: '/GymApp/'
```

If the repository name changes, update this value to match the new GitHub Pages path:

```ts
base: '/NEW_REPOSITORY_NAME/'
```

Also update these files if the repo path changes:

- `public/manifest.webmanifest`
- `public/sw.js`

For a custom domain at the web root, use:

```ts
base: '/'
```

## How Data Works

The app saves first to browser `localStorage` so the workout flow remains fast and resilient.

The app stores:

- Program definitions, including Program A, Program B, and Flexibility
- Exercise definitions
- Workout history
- Most recent value per exercise

The storage code lives in `src/services/storageService.ts` so localStorage access is not scattered through the app.

After finishing a program, the app also attempts to sync the complete export to this repository:

```text
data/workout-data.json
data/codex-land-training-summary.json
```

The sync uses a fine-grained GitHub token for `PaulNichols/GymApp` with **Contents: Read and write** permission. The token is prompted for on first sync and stored only in `sessionStorage`, not in source code or localStorage.

The repository summary avoids raw notes and is the preferred file for weekly Codex coaching. The full `workout-data.json` remains available when deeper review is needed.

Privacy note: this repository is public, so committed workout data is publicly readable.

## Use the App

1. Open the app on your phone.
2. Choose **Program A**, **Program B**, or **Flexibility**.
3. Work through one exercise at a time.
4. Check the visual cue card or tap **Watch form videos** for YouTube form search results.
5. Enter today’s value and optional notes.
6. Tap **Save and Next**.
7. Tap **Finish Program** on the final exercise.

Each exercise shows the most recent saved value, for example `Last time: 35 kg`. If there is no history, it shows `No previous entry`.

Each default exercise also includes a short swimming transfer note explaining how it helps and which stroke it supports.

## Edit Programs

Open **Admin / Edit Programs** to:

- View Program A or Program B
- Add exercises
- Edit exercise name, equipment, unit, category, and image URL
- Edit YouTube URL and visual cue text
- Edit the swimming transfer description
- Delete exercises
- Move exercises up or down
- Reset back to the default programs

Program edits are stored in `localStorage`.

## Export Data

Open **Export / Import Data** and tap **Export Data**.

The app downloads a JSON file containing:

- App version
- Export date/time
- Program definitions
- Workout history

Keep this file somewhere safe if your phone browser data matters.

## Sync Data

Open **Export / Import Data** and tap **Sync to GitHub** to push the current local programs and workout history to the repository.

The app also syncs after **Finish Program** and after successful imports. If you cancel the token prompt or GitHub rejects the token, the session remains saved locally and the app shows the sync error.

To rebuild the Codex summary locally:

```bash
npm run summarise:workouts
```

## Import Data

Open **Export / Import Data**, tap **Import Data**, and choose a previous JSON export.

The app validates the basic shape of the file and asks for confirmation before replacing your current programs and history.

## Default Programs

Program A is Pull, legs, core.

Program B is Swim power, back, hips, shoulders.

Flexibility is a 10-15 minute land mobility routine for evenings, after a walk, or after a shower. It includes cat-camel, child's pose, lower-back rotations, hip flexor, glute, hamstring, calf, forward fold, and thoracic rotation work.

The included default exercises match the first version requirements and use sensible default units such as `kg` and `seconds`.

Each default exercise also includes three short form cues and a YouTube search link. The app does not bundle copyrighted exercise photos or videos.

## PWA Support

The app includes a web app manifest, placeholder icon, theme colour, and a small service worker for basic offline caching after the production site has loaded once.

On iPhone, open the deployed GitHub Pages site in Safari and use **Add to Home Screen**.
